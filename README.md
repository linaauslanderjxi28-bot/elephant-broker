# ElephantBroker

**A knowledge-grounded cognitive runtime for trustworthy AI agents.**

Elephants never forget, brokers always deliver — ElephantBroker is a unified cognitive runtime that gives AI agents durable memory, goal-aware context assembly, evidence-backed verification, and cheap-first safety enforcement. Built on a Cognee-powered knowledge plane (Neo4j graph + Qdrant vectors), it replaces flat vector stores with a structured, trustworthy, and profile-tuned memory system.

> **Paper:** [arXiv:2603.25097](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.25097) — *ElephantBroker: A Knowledge-Grounded Cognitive Runtime for Trustworthy AI Agents*

## Key Capabilities

- **Hybrid five-source retrieval** — structural graph queries, lexical matching, semantic vector search, ego-net graph expansion, and artifact retrieval, merged with configurable per-source weights
- **Eleven-dimension competitive scoring** — turn relevance, goal relevance, recency, successful-use prior, confidence with verification multipliers, evidence strength, novelty, redundancy/contradiction penalties, and token cost. Budget-constrained greedy selection with a (1−1/e) submodularity guarantee
- **Four-state evidence verification** — UNVERIFIED → SELF-SUPPORTED → TOOL-SUPPORTED → SUPERVISOR-VERIFIED, with graded confidence multipliers (0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0) feeding into scoring
- **Five-stage context lifecycle** — bootstrap, ingest, assemble, compact, afterTurn. Four-block assembly across two prompt surfaces, six-signal successful-use detection, subagent spawn/end hooks
- **Six-layer guard pipeline** — autonomy domain classification → static rules → semantic matching → structural validators → forced constraint reinjection → optional LLM escalation
- **Nine-stage consolidation engine** — cluster, canonicalize, strengthen, decay, prune, promote, refine procedures, identify verification gaps, recompute salience. Seven of nine stages require zero LLM calls
- **Authority-based multi-org identity** — four-tier numeric permission hierarchy, eleven configurable authority rules, organizations and teams as first-class graph entities

## Architecture

ElephantBroker is organized as a monorepo: the backend runtime, infrastructure,
agent plugins, configuration snapshots, and integration tests live together so
API/schema changes and plugin adapters can evolve atomically.

```
Layer A  Agent Integration     TypeScript/Python plugins (24+ tools, lifecycle hooks)
            ↓ HTTP + X-EB-* identity headers
Layer B  Cognitive Runtime     Python (17 modules, 84 API endpoints, FastAPI)
           ↓ Cognee SDK
Layer C  Knowledge Plane       Cognee v0.5.x (7 DataPoint subclasses, graph+vector search)
           ↓
Layer D  Infrastructure        Neo4j · Qdrant · Redis · SQLite · OTEL/Prometheus
```

The runtime API is consumed by two thin OpenClaw plugin surfaces plus additional
agent adapters under `plugins/`:

- **MemoryPlugin** — 24 tools across 6 groups (memory, goals, procedures, artifacts, guards, admin) + session lifecycle hooks
- **ContextEnginePlugin** — 7 lifecycle methods (bootstrap, ingest, assemble, compact, afterTurn, subagent spawn/end) with degraded buffered mode

All intelligence, scoring, storage, and policy logic lives in Python. The plugins
are pass-through HTTP adapters kept in the same repository to prevent API/plugin
contract drift.

## Monorepo Layout

This repository is the source of truth for both ElephantBroker backend and
ElephantBroker agent plugins.

- Backend runtime: `elephantbroker/`, `infrastructure/`, `deploy/`, `tests/`.
- Agent plugins: `plugins/claude-code/`, `plugins/antigravity-cli/`,
  `plugins/opencode/`, `plugins/openclaw/`, `plugins/hermes-agent/`.
- Plugin configuration snapshots: `plugins/configs/`.
- OpenClaw plugin packages: `plugins/openclaw/memory/`,
  `plugins/openclaw/context/`, and temporary shared helpers under
  `plugins/openclaw/shared/`.

The old standalone `elephantbroker-memory-plugins` repository is now treated as
a migration source/archive. New plugin changes belong in this monorepo.

Migration targets:

| Previous path | Monorepo target |
|---------------|-----------------|
| `elephantbroker-memory-plugins/claude-code-plugin/` | `plugins/claude-code/` |
| `elephantbroker-memory-plugins/antigravity-cli-plugin/` | `plugins/antigravity-cli/` |
| `elephantbroker-memory-plugins/opencode-plugin/` | `plugins/opencode/` |
| `elephantbroker-memory-plugins/openclaw-plugin/` | `plugins/openclaw/memory/` |
| `openclaw-plugins/elephantbroker-context/` | `plugins/openclaw/context/` |
| `openclaw-plugins/shared/` | `plugins/openclaw/shared/` |
| `elephantbroker-memory-plugins/hermes-agent-plugin/` | `plugins/hermes-agent/` |
| `elephantbroker-memory-plugins/configs/` | `plugins/configs/` |

The legacy root `openclaw-plugins/` path has been superseded by
`plugins/openclaw/`.

## Runtime Modules

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|---------------|
| **ActorRegistry** | Actor CRUD, platform-qualified handles, MEMBER_OF edges, authority chains |
| **GoalManager** | Scope-aware goal CRUD (8 scopes), OWNS_GOAL filtering, blocker tracking |
| **MemoryStoreFacade** | Fact CRUD, dedup at 0.95 cosine similarity, graph edges, GDPR delete |
| **WorkingSetManager** | 11-dimension scoring, budget-constrained greedy selection |
| **ContextAssembler** | 4-block assembly across 2 prompt surfaces |
| **CompactionEngine** | Two-stage: rule-classify (zero LLM) + LLM-summarize. Goal-aware |
| **RetrievalOrchestrator** | 5-source concurrent retrieval with weighted merge |
| **RerankOrchestrator** | 4-stage: cheap prune → semantic → cross-encoder (Qwen3-Reranker-4B) → dedup |
| **ProcedureEngine** | Procedure CRUD, step execution, completion gates, proof validation |
| **EvidenceEngine** | 4-state claim tracking, proof validation, reject with mandatory reason |

| **StatsEngine** | 49 Prometheus counters/gauges |
| **ScoringTuner** | Per-gateway weight persistence (SQLite), EMA-smoothed deltas (±5% cap) |

### Adapters

| Adapter | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **GraphAdapter** | Structural reads (`query_cypher`, `get_neighbors`), custom edges, GDPR delete. No writes. |
| **VectorAdapter** | Filtered vector search on Cognee-managed collections. GDPR delete. No writes. |
| **EmbeddingService** | Dedup similarity checks, query embedding |
| **LLMClient** | LiteLLM wrapper with model prefix routing, token estimation |

> **Cognee is the knowledge plane.** All DataPoints are stored via `add_data_points()`. Adapter write methods have been removed — adapters handle reads, deletes, edges, and structural queries only.

## Data Model

**Seven DataPoint subclasses** map schemas to graph-vector storage:

| Entity | Indexed Fields | Vector Collection |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| FactDataPoint | text | FactDataPoint_text |
| ActorDataPoint | display_name | ActorDataPoint_display_name |
| GoalDataPoint | title, description | GoalDataPoint_title |
| ProcedureDataPoint | name, description | ProcedureDataPoint_name |
| ArtifactDataPoint | summary | ArtifactDataPoint_summary |
| OrganizationDataPoint | name | OrganizationDataPoint_name |
| TeamDataPoint | name | TeamDataPoint_name |

**Five memory classes:** EPISODIC (decays, promotable to SEMANTIC after 3+ sessions), SEMANTIC (durable knowledge), PROCEDURAL (workflows, no decay), POLICY (non-negotiable constraints, always injected), WORKING_MEMORY (session-only, dropped at end).

**Eight scopes:** GLOBAL → ORGANIZATION → TEAM → ACTOR → SESSION → TASK → SUBAGENT → ARTIFACT, each with distinct visibility rules, decay cadence, and promotion targets.

**Twelve fact categories:** identity, preference, event, decision, system, relationship, trait, project, general, constraint, procedure_ref, verification.

## Identity Model

Three-level isolation enforced across all infrastructure:

| Level | Identifier | Scope |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| **Gateway** | `EB_GATEWAY_ID` | Redis keys, Cypher WHERE clauses, dataset prefixes, metrics, traces, logs |
| **Agent** | `agent_key = {gateway_id}:{agentId}` | Deterministic UUID v5, registers as ActorRef |
| **Session** | `sessionKey` (stable) + `sessionId` (ephemeral) | Routing + lifecycle |

Four `X-EB-*` headers transmitted on every request. `GatewayIdentityMiddleware` extracts them into `request.state`.

**Authority model:** Regular actor (0-49) < Team lead (50-69) < Org admin (70-89) < System admin (90+). Eleven configurable rules with matching-exempt semantics.

## Retrieval Pipeline

Formalized as **f(α) = σ(ρ(φ(α)))** — multi-source search (recall) → four-stage reranker (precision) → eleven-dimension scoring + budget selection (value optimization).

**Five sources** dispatched concurrently:

| Source | Method | Default Weight |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Structural | Neo4j Cypher (session_key, actor, scope filters) | 0.4 |
| Keyword | Cognee `CHUNKS_LEXICAL` (BM25-like) | 0.3 |
| Semantic | Cognee `CHUNKS` or direct vector | 0.5 |
| Graph expansion | Cognee `GRAPH_COMPLETION` (ego-net traversal) | 0.2 |
| Artifact | Vector search over artifact collections | 0.5 |

**Four-stage reranking:** cheap prune (token overlap + retrieval score) → semantic reranking (cosine similarity) → cross-encoder (Qwen3-Reranker-4B) → near-duplicate merge (union-find, cosine > 0.95).

Five-level graceful degradation — no single backend failure blocks the pipeline.

## Scoring

**Pass 1 — Nine independent dimensions:** turn relevance, session goal relevance, global goal relevance, recency (exponential decay with per-profile half-life), successful-use prior, confidence × verification multiplier, evidence strength, novelty, cost penalty.

**Pass 2 — Two interaction-dependent dimensions** (computed during greedy selection): redundancy penalty (cosine similarity to already-selected), contradiction penalty (graph edges + semantic confidence gap).

Mandatory items (constraints, goals with blockers, procedures requiring proof) pre-allocated unconditionally. Remaining candidates selected greedily under token budget.

**Per-profile presets** (coding, research, managerial, worker, personal_assistant) control all weights, half-life, budget, isolation level, graph mode, and graph depth.

## Guard Pipeline

Six layers, each cheaper than the next:

| Layer | Method | Cost |
|-------|--------|------|
| 0. Autonomy classification | 10 domains × 4 autonomy levels | Microseconds |
| 1. Static rules | 16 builtins + profile + procedure-bound + custom | Microseconds |
| 2. Semantic matching | BM25 + cosine similarity against exemplars | Milliseconds |
| 3. Structural validation | Graph queries for approvals, evidence, confirmations | Milliseconds |
| 4. Forced reinjection | Constraints injected into Block 1 of context assembly | Zero LLM |
| 5. LLM escalation | Safety-focused prompt for ambiguous cases (opt-in) | One LLM call |

Near-miss escalation: three `warn` results within five turns auto-tightens strictness.

**Procedures-Guards-Evidence triangle:** procedure activation loads guard bindings → guard violation demands evidence → procedure completion validates all proof requirements.

## Consolidation ("Sleep") Pipeline

Nine stages, gateway-scoped with Redis distributed lock:

1. **Cluster near-duplicates** — cosine > 0.92, union-find
2. **Canonicalize** — majority voting, LLM only for ambiguous (<5%)
3. **Strengthen** — `c' = min(c + s/u × 0.3, 1.0)` for high-success facts
4. **Decay** — recalled-unused: `c × 0.9^t_r`, never-recalled: `c × 0.95^t_d`
5. **Prune autorecall** — blacklist 5+ recalls with 0 successful uses
6. **Promote** — EPISODIC → SEMANTIC after 3+ sessions
7. **Refine procedures** — trace pattern detection + LLM draft (1 LLM call)
8. **Verification gaps** — missing evidence flagged for supervisor
9. **Recompute salience** — EMA weight adjustment, capped at ±5%

Seven of nine stages require zero LLM calls.
