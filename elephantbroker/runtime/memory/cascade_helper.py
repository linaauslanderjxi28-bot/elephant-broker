"""Shared TD-50 Cognee-cascade helper used by the memory facade and the
consolidation canonicalize stage.

Extracted from `facade._cascade_cognee_data` (TODO-5-314) so both call
sites share one implementation, including the Cfx TD-Cognee-Qdrant-404
recovery branch. Prior to this module canonicalize carried an
"intentionally duplicated" copy without the recovery branch — a drift
hazard, since a cluster canonicalized against a never-cognify()'d member
would 404 in Qdrant mid-cascade and leave the Data↔Dataset association
orphaned.

PIN INVARIANT (TODO-5-006): This cascade calls Cognee internal paths
that are NOT part of Cognee's public API stability contract:
  - `cognee.modules.users.methods.get_default_user`
  - `cognee.modules.data.methods.get_datasets_by_name`
  - `cognee.datasets.delete_data(mode="soft", delete_dataset_if_empty=False)`
  - `cognee.modules.data.methods.get_dataset_data` (TD-Cognee-Qdrant-404
    recovery path — re-fetches Data rows to complete metadata cleanup
    when the Qdrant step throws UnexpectedResponse mid-cascade)
  - `cognee.modules.data.methods.delete_data` (same recovery path —
    removes the Data ↔ Dataset association that Cognee's outer
    delete_data would have finalized on its last line)
The `cognee==1.2.2` pin in pyproject.toml is load-bearing — bumping
Cognee without re-verifying each call site (signature, kwargs, return
shape) will silently break the TD-50 cascade path.
See local/TECHNICAL-DEBT.md §"Load-bearing dependency pins" for the
full impact surface + bump protocol, and §"TD-Cognee-Qdrant-404" for
the upstream bug that necessitates the recovery branch.

BULK-DELETE CAVEAT (TODO-5-312): This cascade is per-fact by design;
`get_default_user` + `get_datasets_by_name` are re-fetched on every
call. No bulk-delete caller exists today. When one is added (e.g. a
GDPR bulk-purge endpoint), implement a batch variant that caches the
two lookups once per batch rather than looping this function N times.

      "skipped_no_dataset"   — Dataset lookup returned nothing (the
                               EB-side delete still proceeds; there
                               is nothing Cognee-side left to clean).

                               because no Cognee call is even
                               attempted — nothing to retry at the
                               Cognee layer.

                               cognee_data_id (None/missing) — the

                               cascade_status is statically typeable.
