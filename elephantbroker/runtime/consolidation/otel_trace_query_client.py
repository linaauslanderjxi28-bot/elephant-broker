"""OtelTraceQueryClient — queries ClickHouse for cross-session trace analytics.

Used by Stage 7 to detect repeated tool call sequences across sessions.
Graceful degradation: returns empty results when ClickHouse not configured.

F6 (TODO-3-611): when ClickHouse is unavailable (missing dependency, failed
connection, query error) the client now emits ``DEGRADED_OPERATION`` trace
events and bumps the ``eb_degraded_operations_total`` counter so operators
can see *why* Stage 7 fell back to the SQLite-only path. Previously the
warning logs were the only signal and were silently lost on hosts that
shipped logs to a sink with no warning-level filter.
