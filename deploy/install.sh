# ElephantBroker DB-VM installer
# =============================================================================
#
# Sets up a fresh DB VM for ElephantBroker:
#   0. Installs uv (Astral's Python package manager) if missing
#   1. Creates the dedicated `elephantbroker` system user
#   2. Creates /opt/elephantbroker, /etc/elephantbroker, /var/lib/elephantbroker
#   3. Runs `uv sync --frozen --no-dev` — installs the venv at
#      /opt/elephantbroker/.venv with the EXACT versions pinned in
#      pyproject.toml + uv.lock. This covers BOTH the elephantbroker runtime
#      AND the hitl-middleware package, because hitl-middleware is declared
#      as a uv workspace member in the root pyproject.toml.
#   4. Applies belt-and-suspenders post-install fixes (Cognee writable dirs
#      + mistralai ghost-package safety net for the pip path)
#   5. Copies default.yaml + env.example + hitl.env.example into /etc/elephantbroker
#      and auto-generates EB_HITL_CALLBACK_SECRET on first install
#   6. Chowns ONLY the Cognee writable subdirs to the service user;
#      $PREFIX itself stays root-owned for defense in depth
#   7. Installs the systemd units (unless --no-systemd)
#   8. Smoke-test: invoke `elephantbroker --help` to verify the venv is
#      functional and the entry-point binary is on the right path
#
# Why uv (not pip):
#   - The lockfile (uv.lock) is mandatory by default — `uv sync` always uses it.
#   - Reproducible builds: bit-for-bit identical installs across machines.
#   - 10-100x faster than pip.
#   - Resolves cognee 0.5.3 + mistralai cleanly without the force-reinstall hack
#     pip needed (uv's holistic resolver picks a working mistralai version).
#   - See deploy/UPDATING-DEPS.md for the dep upgrade workflow.
#
# Usage (typical — in-tree, $REPO_DIR == $PREFIX):
#   sudo git clone https://github.com/elephant-broker/elephant-broker.git /opt/elephantbroker
#   sudo /opt/elephantbroker/deploy/install.sh
#   sudo nano /etc/elephantbroker/env       # fill in EB_LLM_API_KEY etc
#   sudo nano /etc/elephantbroker/hitl.env  # fill in EB_HITL_CALLBACK_SECRET
#   sudo systemctl start elephantbroker elephantbroker-hitl
#
# Usage (out-of-tree — $REPO_DIR != $PREFIX, requires --allow-out-of-tree):
#   sudo git clone https://github.com/elephant-broker/elephant-broker.git /tmp/eb-src
#   sudo /tmp/eb-src/deploy/install.sh --allow-out-of-tree --prefix /opt/elephantbroker
#   # Remaining env/hitl/systemctl steps identical to the in-tree flow above.
#
# OOT mode exists for CI sandboxes, build hosts, and bind-mounted source
# layouts where the git working tree cannot live at $PREFIX. The flag is
# opt-in (default-off) because the supported production workflow is to clone
# directly into $PREFIX — see C2 (TODO-3-202/602/011) for the rationale and
# the safety guards that still fire in OOT mode.
#
# This script is idempotent — safe to re-run on a partially-installed host.
# It runs entirely as root (no `sudo -u` switching). All ownership is set via
# `chown` after the privileged operations complete.
#
# Flags:
#   --no-systemd            Skip installing systemd unit files
#   --prefix PATH           Override the install prefix (default: /opt/elephantbroker)
#   --allow-out-of-tree     Permit running install.sh from a directory other
#                           than $PREFIX. WITHOUT this flag, the script refuses
#                           to run unless the source repo IS the prefix — the
#                           supported workflow is to clone directly into
#                           /opt/elephantbroker. See C2 (TODO-3-202/602/011)
#                           for the rationale.

ElephantBroker DB-VM installer

Usage:
  sudo ./install.sh [--no-systemd] [--prefix PATH] [--allow-out-of-tree]
                    [--service-name NAME] [--hitl-service-name NAME]

Flags:
  --no-systemd            Skip installing systemd unit files
  --prefix PATH           Override the install prefix (default: /opt/elephantbroker)
  --allow-out-of-tree     Permit running install.sh from a directory other than
                          $PREFIX. WITHOUT this flag, the script refuses to run
                          unless the source repo IS the prefix. See note below.
  --service-name NAME     Override the runtime systemd unit name (default:
                          "elephantbroker"; env: EB_SERVICE_NAME). The unit is
                          installed at /etc/systemd/system/<NAME>.service.
  --hitl-service-name NAME
                          Override the HITL systemd unit name (default:
                          "<SERVICE_NAME>-hitl"; env: EB_HITL_SERVICE_NAME).
                          Use this to run multiple co-tenant runtimes on one
                          host without systemd unit-name collisions.
  --help, -h              Show this message

Typical workflow:
  sudo git clone <repo-url> /opt/elephantbroker
  sudo /opt/elephantbroker/deploy/install.sh
  sudo nano /etc/elephantbroker/env       # fill in EB_LLM_API_KEY etc
  sudo nano /etc/elephantbroker/hitl.env  # fill in EB_HITL_CALLBACK_SECRET
  sudo systemctl start elephantbroker elephantbroker-hitl

The script is idempotent — safe to re-run on a partially-installed host.
It runs entirely as root (no sudo -u switching). All ownership is set
via chown after the privileged operations complete.

Out-of-tree installs (--allow-out-of-tree):
  uv sync writes the venv to <source-repo>/.venv. The systemd units
  hardcode /opt/elephantbroker/.venv/bin/elephantbroker. If the source
  repo is NOT the prefix, the venv lives at the wrong path and systemd
  startup fails. The --allow-out-of-tree flag exists only as an explicit
  opt-in for advanced users who know they will fix the venv path themselves.

#     hitl-middleware workspace member in editable mode (both share the
#     same venv)
#
# Workspace mode: hitl-middleware is declared as a [tool.uv.workspace] member
# in the root pyproject.toml. The root uv.lock is the single source of truth
# for both packages, so a separate `uv pip install hitl-middleware` is no
# longer needed (and would in fact reintroduce the dependency-drift bug it
# was being used to "fix").
#
# --all-packages is REQUIRED because hitl-middleware is a workspace member but
# not a dependency of the root elephantbroker project; without this flag
# `uv sync` skips it and /opt/elephantbroker/.venv/bin/hitl-middleware is
# never created, breaking the elephantbroker-hitl systemd unit with
# status=203/EXEC on every fresh install. Discovered during the first
# staging install of PR #3 (post-merge) on 2026-04-09.

#
# The runtime AND the hitl-middleware must agree on the same HMAC secret or
# every HITL approval callback fails verification. Historically the operator
# was told (in `Next steps:` below) to run `openssl rand -hex 32` and paste
# the result into BOTH /etc/elephantbroker/env AND /etc/elephantbroker/hitl.env.
# In practice this was the #1 cause of "first start works for everything
# except HITL" because operators routinely (a) forgot, (b) generated different
# values for the two files, or (c) pasted with surrounding whitespace.
#
# When BOTH env files were freshly copied in this run, we generate one secret
# and patch it into both. If only one was freshly copied (the other already
# exists with operator-customized contents), we leave the placeholder alone
# and warn the operator — auto-generating one half would silently break the
# existing pair.

# C4 (TODO-3-013, TODO-3-222): validate the on-disk config BEFORE handing

# runtime uses at startup, so any structural failure (extra="forbid"
# violation, embedding model/dim mismatch, malformed YAML, env coercion
# error) surfaces here as a clear install-log error instead of a confusing
# journalctl failure 30 seconds later.
#
# The earlier version treated validation failure as a warning on the
# reasoning that a fresh-install config would refuse to load because of
# sentinel-default gateway_id / empty neo4j_password. That reasoning was
# wrong: `config validate` invokes `ElephantBrokerConfig.load()` which is
# pure Pydantic — it does NOT call `_validate_startup_safety`, so the
# fresh-install sentinel defaults pass validation cleanly. The Bucket A
# runtime safety guards (A3/A4/A5) fire later, at
# `RuntimeContainer.from_config()` time, which is the right layer for
# "did the operator fill in secrets". Treating validate-failure as a
# warning therefore hid real schema bugs (extra="forbid" typos, embedding
# dim mismatches) behind a noisy "service won't start" 30 seconds later
# — exactly the UX regression Bucket C was trying to prevent.

Next steps:
  1. Fill in the required secrets in /etc/elephantbroker/env :
        EB_LLM_API_KEY=...
        EB_EMBEDDING_API_KEY=...
        EB_NEO4J_PASSWORD=...                   # REQUIRED — runtime refuses to boot if empty

     NOTE (TODO-3-624): EB_HITL_CALLBACK_SECRET is auto-generated by this
     installer (F11) on a fresh install — the same random 32-byte hex
     value is written to BOTH /etc/elephantbroker/env and
     /etc/elephantbroker/hitl.env, and the installer now verifies the
     sed anchor actually matched before exiting. You do NOT need to run
     \`openssl rand -hex 32\` manually on fresh installs. If you re-run
     the installer on a host with existing env files, the auto-gen is
     SKIPPED (to avoid breaking the existing HMAC pair). To deliberately
     rotate the secret, regenerate it by hand and make sure the SAME
     value lands in BOTH files — a mismatch will fail every HITL
     callback with "signature mismatch".

  2. Set gateway_id in /etc/elephantbroker/default.yaml to a deployment-
     specific value (REQUIRED — the runtime refuses to boot with the empty
     sentinel default; two hosts that share the same gateway_id collide on
     Redis, ClickHouse, and Neo4j). For example:
        gateway:
          gateway_id: "gw-prod-eu1"     # any unique label per host
        # Override at runtime via EB_GATEWAY_ID if you prefer env-based config.

  3. Review the rest of /etc/elephantbroker/default.yaml (org_id, team_id,
     reranker, etc.) — most operators only need to change those few fields.

  4. Make sure your infrastructure (Neo4j / Qdrant / Redis) is running. The
     project ships a docker-compose file at infrastructure/docker-compose.yml:
        cd $REPO_DIR/infrastructure && docker compose up -d

  5. Start the services:
        sudo systemctl start $SERVICE_NAME $HITL_SERVICE_NAME

  6. Verify:
        systemctl status $SERVICE_NAME $HITL_SERVICE_NAME
        curl http://localhost:8420/health/    # note trailing slash
        curl http://localhost:8421/health
        journalctl -u $SERVICE_NAME -f
